			     Booting Pintos
			     ==============

---- QUESTIONS ---- 
>> Put the screenshots of Pintos running in src/p0.
>> A1: Is there any particular issue that you would like us to know?

			     Debugging
			     =========

---- QUESTIONS: BIOS ---- 
>> B1: What is the first instruction that gets executed?
ANS:      ljmp   $0x3630,$0xf000e05b

>> B2: At which physical address is this instruction located?
ANS:    0X000ffff0

>> B3: Can you guess why the first instruction is like this?

ANS: Before moving on to or jumping to the startup code the kernel needs to access BIOS, which is done 
     using the jmp command acting as a control instruction.
     The long pointer right before jmp provides 16 bits for the CS register and 16 or 32 bits for the EIP register which are used.
     0x3630 for the CS register and $0xf000e05b for the EIP register, pointing to the next instruction as seen in the next question. 	

>> B4: What are the next three instructions?
	
ANS:The next 3 instructions were:
             cmpw   $0xffc8,%cs:(%esi)
             jne    0xd241d416
             xor    %edx,%edx
	

---- QUESTIONS: BOOTLOADER ---- 
>> B5: How does the bootloader read disk sectors? In particular, what BIOS interrupt
is used?

ANS:A sector read subroutine is used where it takes a drive number in DL register (0x80 = hard
    disk 0, 0x81 = hard disk 1, ...) and a sector number in EBX, and
    reads the specified sector into memory at ES:0000. INT 13h is used.

>> B6: How does the bootloader decides whether it successfully finds the Pintos kernel?

ANS: The bootloader reads the partition table on each system hard disk and scans for a
     partition of type 0x20, finding which ensures that Pintos kernel is successfully found.

>> B7: What happens when the bootloader could not find the Pintos kernel?

ANS: If the bootloader didn't find a pintos kernel partition 
     anywhere it gives up and prints "Not found" to the console.
     Then it notifies BIOS that boot failed using INT 18h.


>> B8: At what point and how exactly does the bootloader transfer control to the Pintos kernel?

ANS: After successfully finding the bootable kernel, the loader reads the partition's contents into memory at physical address 128 kB
     and now it's time to transfer control to it. It reads the start
     address out of the ELF header (see [ELF1]) and converts it from a
     32-bit linear address into a 16:16 segment:offset address for
     real mode, then jumps to the converted address.

---- QUESTIONS: KERNEL ---- 
>> B9: At the entry of pintos_init(), what is the value of expression 
init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))] in hexadecimal format?

>> B10: When palloc_get_page() is called for the first time,

>> B10.1 what does the call stack look like?

>> B10.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?

>> B10.3 what is the value of expression init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))] in hexadecimal format?

>> B11: When palloc_get_page() is called for the third time,

>> B11.1 what does the call stack look like?

>> B11.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?

>> B11.3 what is the value of expression init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))] in hexadecimal format?

			     Kernel Monitor
			     ==============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.  

ANS:No new structs had to be declared for this part of the project.
    The only new global variable type that I learned from this part of the project was
    uint8_t which is a shorthand for: a type of unsigned integer of length 8 bits and was used to 
    hold the ASCII code for the returns of input_getc() used to read individual characters from the console.   
        

---- ALGORITHMS ----
>> C2: Explain how you read and write to the console for the kernel monitor.

ANS:The function that was used for reading characters is input_getc() from the file
    in  "devices/input.c" and putbuf() from "lib/kernel/console.c".
    
    inputgetc() read characters individually  and returned it's ASCII code which is of type uin8_t.
    Then I converted the ASCII code to it's corresponding character.
    used putbuf() to write down each of these characters to the console when they are typed; till ENTER KEY is pressed.
    As the ENTER KEY is pressed print statements handle the rest of the demanded procedure.
    
>> C3: Any additional enhancement you implement?
